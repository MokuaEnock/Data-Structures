# Data Structures.

A data type in javascript is one of the forms of the variable to which the value can be assigned of a given type only, this value can be used throughout the value. There are various forms of data types in javascript these are; integers, strings, booleans, undefined and null.
In computer science, a data structure is a format to organize manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification, therefore a data structure can be loosely defined as a collection of data values. A data structure is a collection of data values the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

Javascript has **built-in** and **non-built-in** data structures, built-in data structures come with javascript and can be implemented out of the box like arrays and objects.
An example of an array and object is;
<pre>
<code>
/* array */
let scores = [24, 34, 56, 78];
let names = ["John", "Doe", "Tony", "Denise"];


/* Objects */
const namesAndScores = {
  John: 24,
  Doe: 34,
  Tony: 56,
  Denise: 78,
};
</code>
</pre>
