# Array.

Arrays store data as an ordered collection and each element is assigned an index starting from 0 to n for an array with n elements. Arrays can hold different data types at a time for example the following example is a valid javascript array;

<pre>
<code>
let array = ["one", 2, "three", 4];
</code>
</pre>

In javascript array are primitve and contain the following characteristics;
> Arrays start from the index zero and the index of the last element is the lenght (total elements in an array) minus 1.
>
> Javascript arrays are resizable (elemnts can be added and removed) and can contain a mixture of different data types. For using a single data type in an array, you can opt to use **Typed Arrays**
>
>Javascript arrays are not associative arrays therefore array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings but are accessed using the element's index.
>Javascript array-copy-operations create shallow copies.
