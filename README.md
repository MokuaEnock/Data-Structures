# Data Structures.

A data type in javascript is one of the forms of the variable to which the value can be assigned of a given type only, this value can be used throughout the value. There are various forms of data types in javascript these are; integers, strings, booleans, undefined and null.
In computer science, a data structure is a format to organize manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification, therefore a data structure can be loosely defined as a collection of data values. A data structure is a collection of data values the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

Javascript has **built-in** and **non-built-in** data structures, built-in data structures come with javascript and can be implemented out of the box like arrays and objects.
An example of an array and object is;

<pre>
<code>
/* array */
let scores = [24, 34, 56, 78];
let names = ["John", "Doe", "Tony", "Denise"];


/* Objects */
const namesAndScores = {
  John: 24,
  Doe: 34,
  Tony: 56,
  Denise: 78,
};
</code>
</pre>

Non primitive data structures or built-in data structures are coded from scratch when we want to use them. Different data structures exist because some are suited for different use cases more than others.

These data structures are;

<ol>

<li><a href="#">Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Queue</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Linked List</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Set</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Hash Table</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Tree</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Trie</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Graph</a></li>

</ol>
